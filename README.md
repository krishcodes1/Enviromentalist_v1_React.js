Navigating the App

users must create an account. the login button might be blended into the backgroun due to supabase having some loading issues but once clicked on it will stay on 

Once logged in, you can explore the application interface.

Pages and transitions may take a moment to load fully due to free plan limitations—please allow time for all assets to render.

Features to Test
The app includes the following features and sections:

Community System: Create and browse communities, similar to Reddit.

Event Posting & Discovery: Host or join events such as cleanups or food drives.

Chat System: Test basic messaging functionality within the app.

Profile Management: Access your profile and explore user-based interactions.

Mobile Responsiveness: The UI adapts to different screen sizes; feel free to test on both desktop and mobile.

Expected Behaviors

Background Images: May take a few seconds to load due to free-tier constraints.

Animations and Transitions: Smooth but not instant—be patient if content is slightly delayed.

Known Limitations

No premium features such as real-time syncing or custom domains are currently enabled.

Backend services may occasionally throttle depending on traffic or resource usage.

Optional – Local Testing
If you'd like to clone and run the project locally, you can do so from my GitHub repository (linked below). This ensures better performance and more control:
